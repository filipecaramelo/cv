                            <p><em>MSc in <strong>Bioinformatics and Computational Biology</strong></em></p>
                            <p>Lisbon Area - Portugal</p>
                            <p>Since I was a child, I have been fascinated with computers and technology. In high school, I sought to learn more about technology than traditional subjects. By believing I could break the boundaries of conventional education, I was able to complete a specialization in multimedia and another in graphic illustration before moving on to Genetics. I was always trying to understand how computers could assist me, so I turned to Bioinformatics, which taught me Data Science and more programming skills. I feel I can be an useful team member, as I have a strong sense of determination, a strong work ethic, excellent adaption, and communication skills. Iâ€™m looking for a place where I can develop and learn more from others, as my ultimate objective in life is to improve as a person and as a profession.</p>
